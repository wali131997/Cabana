            Cabana Capitals ensure secure trading by offering the benefits of negative balance protection to all its clients: Our risk management system ensures that the client cannot lose more than he initially invested. If the balance becomes negative due to Stop Out, significant economic events, when sudden market movements drastically affect the value of assets, or due to high volatility and price gaps, a customer can lose his/her equity. Cabana Capitals will compensate the extra amount and adjust the account balance to zero.

                className="mr-1"
              />
             With negative balance protection enabled, your trading account will never turn negative. Even if the traders face a bad loss, they will ultimately pay for the maximum deposited amount. There will not be a negative balance loss, and it will save you from debt.
