              <p className="aboutDetailText">
                Currencies are always traded in pairs, with the first currency
                in the pair called the base currency and the second called the
                quote currency. Forex traders simultaneously buy one currency in
                the pair and sell the other, depending on how they think the
                currencies’ values will change in relation to each other.
              </p>
              <p className="aboutDetailText">
                Currency values can be affected by a vast number of fundamental
                factors that impact the health of a nation’s economy, including
                inflation, interest rates, government debt levels and political
                stability. Typically, forex investors find the greatest
                volatility before and after key economic or political
                announcements as traders speculate on their potential impact.
              </p>
              <p className="aboutDetailText">
                Currency pairs are split into three categories. Major currency
                pairs are the most traded pairs in the forex industry and
                therefore enjoy the most liquidity. They usually include the US
                dollar as one half of the pair, like the EUR/USD and the
                USD/JPY. Other commonly traded major pairs include EUR/JPY and
                the EUR/GBP.
              </p>
              <p className="aboutDetailText">
                The minor currency pairs are the less popular combinations that
                still contain major currencies. They are also sometimes called
                'Crosses'. Examples include the EUR/NZD and the AUD/CHF.
              </p>
              <p className="aboutDetailText">
                Exotic currency pairs are not as widely traded as the majors or
                the minors. They are composed of a major currency pair coupled with
                the currency of a developing economy. Some examples that Cabana
                Capitals offers include the USD/TRY and the EUR/PLN
