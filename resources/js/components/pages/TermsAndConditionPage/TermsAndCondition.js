              The nature of investment in Financial Instruments is such that not all Financial instruments are suitable for everyone unless they:
              <br /><br />
              A. Are knowledgeable in investment matters,<br />
              B. Are able to bear the economic risk of the investment,<br />
              C. Understand the risk involved; and<br />
              D. Believe that the investment is suitable for their particular investment objective and financial needs.<br />
              Should any non-professional investor invests in Financial Instruments, it is advisable that only a part of the sums that the investor intents to invest for long-term should be so invested.
              <br /><br />
              It is also advisable that all investors should seek advice from a professional investment advisor before making any investment in Financial Instruments.</div>
